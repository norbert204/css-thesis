# Working draft CSS features demo

Thesis for Masters Degree in Computer Science.

This is a slideshow application written in React, where I demonstrate CSS features that are in a Working Draft state (as of 2025) by the W3C standard.

## Requirements

To run this application, we need `npm` to be installed. Example command to install on Fedora:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install npm
```

It is also recommended to have `git` installed, to easily clone the repository. Similar example to install under Fedora:

```bash
$ sudo dnf install git
```

Also, we need a web browser to view the application. It is recommended to use a Chromium based web browser,
since these implement CSS features closest to the W3C standard. Some good examples are `Google Chrome` and `Microsoft Edge`.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository, and `cd` into it's directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/norbert204/css-thesis.git
$ cd css-thesis/
```

2. Install the `npm` dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

3. Run the application

```bash
$ npm start
```

4. Navigate to the application in a web browser. By default, it'll be available at <http://localhost:3000>.
